# On your local machine, in your project folder
git add nginx.conf
git commit -m "fix: Correct nginx proxy configuration for Streamlit sub-path"
git push origin main```

**Step 4: Watch the Deployment**
Go to the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. You will see the new workflow running. It will be much faster this time because the base Docker layers are already cached.

Once it completes, wait about 30 seconds for the services to initialize.

**Step 5: Test**
*   **Clear your browser cache** for your droplet's IP address to ensure you aren't loading old files.
*   Go to **`http://165.227.128.129/app/`**

It should now load correctly and be fully interactive. The "Loading..." state should be replaced by the Login/Register page.
