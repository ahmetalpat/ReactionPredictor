# Chemical Reaction Predictor

This application predicts the products of chemical reactions using a state-of-the-art T5-based model.

## How to Use the App

1.  **Input Molecules**: You can either:
    *   Use the **Chemical Drawing Tool** to draw the reactant and reagent molecules.
    *   Go to the **SMILES Text Input** tab and paste the SMILES strings directly.
2.  **Set Parameters**: In the sidebar, you can select the number of predictions you want to generate.
3.  **Predict**: Click the "Predict Product" button to see the results.
4.  **Load Examples**: Use the dropdown in the sidebar to load pre-defined example reactions to see how the app works.

## About the Model

This application uses the `sagawa/ReactionT5v2-forward-USPTO_MIT` model, which has been fine-tuned for forward reaction prediction. It achieves a high accuracy of over 97% on the USPTO_MIT dataset.
